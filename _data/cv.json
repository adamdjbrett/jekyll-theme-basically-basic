   "summary": "Commitment to ministry and education have always been intricately woven together in my life thanks to a family full of public school educators, church leaders, and pastors. I first experienced a call to ministry dur- ing my senior year of college and have nurtured that call through my M.Div. degree and advanced studies in biblical interpretation, as well as in professional and volunteer ministry work. My personal experiences, my educational background, and my professional training have cultivated a number of strengths that make me well-suited for a pastoral position: a passion for education and Christian formation, a skill for worship planning and leadership, a heart for empathetic listening and communication, a gift for bringing out the best in others, a desire to engage in service to the local and global community, and an investment in working with others to discern God’s calling for common life and ministry.",

    "summary": "This article offers a dialogical examination of 1 Kgs 17–19 that deconstructs traditionally accepted characterizations of Jezebel, Elijah, and the Widow of Zarephath. This study proposes that shifting emphasis from Elijah and Jezebel as polar opposites to a literary <em>ménage à trois</em> that involves all three characters makes it possible for the holy man to become a stranger and the strange women to become holy. The narrative tensions thus revealed question the validity of Israel's definitive identity markers. When reading the stories of Jezebel, Elijah, and the Widow of Zarephath in the Deuteronomistic History, clear-cut distinctions between ‘insiders’ and ‘outsiders’ continually collapse."
